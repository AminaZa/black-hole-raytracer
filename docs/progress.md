### 2026-05-07 — Phase 6 + 7: animator and fused acceleration

Two interleaved pieces — the animator made the cost of a render frame
suddenly matter (we'd be paying it tens or hundreds of times), and the
fusion pass attacked the dominant cost.

**Phase 6 — frame loop and animation scripts:**
- `src/render/animator.py` — `Animator` runs a `render_frame(idx, total)`
  callback per frame, saves each frame as a numbered PNG into a staging
  directory, and stitches the result into a GIF via `imageio`. Two
  knobs that turned out to matter: `resume=True` (the default) skips
  frames whose PNG is already on disk, and `max_frames_per_run` caps
  fresh renders per call. Together they make a long animation
  resumable across sessions — important because the Claude Code
  background-task budget is 10 minutes, and a 120-frame 800×600
  animation is 30+ minutes even after the fusion pass.
- `examples/orbit_animation.py` — Kerr a = 0.9, camera at r = 30 M, 75°
  inclination, 120 frames sweeping azimuth 0 → 2π. Output:
  `gallery/orbit_animation.gif` (800 × 600 @ 24 fps).
- `examples/spin_animation.py` — fixed camera, 90 frames with the spin
  parameter sweeping linearly from 0 to 0.99. The metric, ISCO and
  disk inner edge are rebuilt per frame; each frame gets an `a = …`
  label burned into the top-left so the physics story narrates itself.
  Output: `gallery/spin_evolution.gif` (800 × 600 @ 24 fps).
- Both example scripts honour `ANIM_MAX_FRAMES_PER_RUN` (env var) so
  chunked runs are scriptable.

**Phase 7 — fused acceleration kernels:**

The first GPU integrator was launch-overhead bound: per RK4 substep the
metric's `acceleration_batch` issued ~30 small CuPy kernels (one per
arithmetic op), and an 800×600 frame integrated at 11 820 rays/s for a
40 s wall-clock — most of which was kernel-dispatch and small-array
allocations rather than FP64 compute.

Fix: a module-level `@cupy.fuse` function in each metric that
contracts the inner element-wise math into a single CUDA kernel.
- `src/metrics/schwarzschild.py` — `_schwarzschild_accel_fused` (one
  kernel for the whole inlined Schwarzschild acceleration).
  ``acceleration_batch`` dispatches to the fused path when given a cupy
  array and falls back to plain NumPy otherwise.
- `src/metrics/kerr.py` — `_kerr_accel_fused`. Same dispatch story.
  Substantially heavier kernel (full BL metric, derivatives, inverse,
  acceleration contraction inlined) but still one launch.
- Defined inside `if _cupy is not None:` so the module imports cleanly
  on machines without CuPy. The numpy path is untouched.

Numerics: fused vs NumPy agrees to **~3 × 10⁻¹⁴** float64 round-off,
identical to the pre-fusion result. All 56 tests still pass.

Performance — single 800 × 600 Kerr frame at a = 0.99:

| stage                      | rays/s | per-frame (s) |
|----------------------------|--------|---------------|
| CPU 20-worker (Phase 4)    | 1 439  | 333.6         |
| GPU unfused (Phase 5)      | 11 820 |  41.6         |
| GPU fused (this phase)     | 33 800 |  15.1         |

**~2.86× over the unfused GPU path; 22× over the multiprocess CPU.**

The fused-acceleration micro-benchmark dropped per-call cost from a few
ms (unfused) to **0.46 ms** (Kerr) / **0.58 ms** (Schwarzschild) at
N = 50 000. The remaining ~17 ms per RK4 step is the integrator's own
small-kernel chain (where, mask, RK4 update). That's the next
optimisation lever — fusing the RK4 update body itself — but is
deferred; the current speedup already brings full-resolution
animations into a workable range (orbit ≈ 30 min, spin ≈ 22 min).

### 2026-05-07 — Phase 5: GPU acceleration via CuPy

Phase 5 introduces a CuPy-backed batched ray tracer that integrates every
pixel ray simultaneously on the GPU. The CPU multiprocessing path stays
intact; example scripts auto-detect GPU and pick the right backend.

Hardware on this box: **NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti Laptop, 16 GiB, CC 8.6**.

Install: ``cupy-cuda12x`` 13.6.0 plus the supporting NVIDIA wheels —
``nvidia-cuda-runtime-cu12``, ``nvidia-cuda-nvrtc-cu12``,
``nvidia-cuda-cccl-cu12``, ``nvidia-cublas-cu12``, ``nvidia-curand-cu12``,
``nvidia-cusolver-cu12``, ``nvidia-cusparse-cu12``, ``nvidia-cufft-cu12``.
On Windows pure-pip the NVRTC and runtime DLLs live under
``site-packages/nvidia/<lib>/bin``; CuPy needs them registered with
``os.add_dll_directory`` *and* prepended to ``PATH`` before import (so the
transitive ``LoadLibraryEx`` from inside ``nvrtc64_120_0.dll`` finds the
``nvrtc-builtins64_129.dll`` next to it). All of that is hidden inside
:mod:`utils.cuda_loader` — at import it sets up the DLL search paths,
imports CuPy, and exposes ``gpu_available`` and ``xp_module`` for the rest
of the codebase.

New / changed:
- `src/utils/cuda_loader.py` — DLL-path discovery, ``load_cupy``,
  ``device_summary``, ``asnumpy``, ``get_xp``. Linux / Mac just import
  CuPy directly; this whole file is a no-op there.
- `src/metrics/schwarzschild.py` and `src/metrics/kerr.py` — added
  ``acceleration_batch(positions, momenta)`` that mirrors the inlined
  scalar acceleration but operates on (N, 4) arrays. The array module is
  detected from ``positions`` via :func:`utils.cuda_loader.get_xp`, so the
  same code runs on numpy or cupy. CPU and GPU paths agree to ≈ 3·10⁻¹⁴
  on float64.
- `src/geodesic/gpu_integrator.py` — :class:`GpuGeodesicIntegrator` does
  RK4 on the whole (N, 4) ray batch in lockstep, with a per-ray
  ``live_mask`` for horizon / escape / disk termination. Polls
  ``live_mask.any()`` every 32 steps to amortise the GPU→CPU sync cost
  (each ``.any()`` was a full pipeline drain). The integrator is
  array-module agnostic — pass numpy arrays for a CPU dry-run, cupy for
  the GPU path. The 2D termination state machine is encoded as four
  module-level integer constants (``TERM_HORIZON`` etc.) so the result is
  trivially marshalable across the device boundary.
- `src/render/gpu_renderer.py` — :class:`GpuRenderer`. Builds initial
  (positions, momenta) on the host, uploads once, calls the integrator
  once, brings ``(termination, final_position, final_momentum)`` back to
  CPU and shades there. Disk colour and starfield sampling stay on the
  CPU — they're O(N) but small compared to the RK4 loop. Falls back to
  the numpy path when CuPy is unavailable, so the same renderer is also a
  single-process batched CPU renderer.
- `examples/kerr_render.py` and `examples/spin_comparison.py` — both
  scripts pick the GPU renderer when available, log
  ``device_summary()`` at startup, and fall back to the multiprocessing
  CPU path otherwise.
- `tests/metrics/test_acceleration_batch.py` (4 numpy parametrisations,
  2 cupy parametrisations gated on ``gpu_available``). Verifies the
  batched acceleration matches the scalar one element-wise.
- `tests/geodesic/test_gpu_integrator.py` (3 cases). Three canonical
  rays — horizon, escape, disk — agree with the per-ray CPU integrator
  bit-for-bit (interpolated disk crossing matches to 1e-10). A cupy-only
  case verifies the CuPy device path matches the numpy host path.

Performance (single-thread Python driver):

| Backend                  | 480k Kerr a=0.99 rays | rays/s    | Speedup vs single-thread CPU |
|--------------------------|-----------------------|-----------|------------------------------|
| CPU single-thread Kerr   | ≈ 35 min              | ~230      | 1×                           |
| CPU 8 workers (Phase 4)  | 5.6 min               | 1 439     | 6.3×                         |
| GPU batch (this phase)   | ≈ 45 s                | 10 620    | 46×                          |

The GPU win comes from launching ~30 vectorised kernels per RK4 step over
the full 480k-ray batch instead of running per-ray Python loops on 8 CPU
cores. The remaining headroom is kernel-launch overhead and many small
intermediate allocations in ``acceleration_batch`` — a fused custom CUDA
kernel (or ``cupy.fuse``) over the RK4 substep would fold those together
and is the obvious next optimisation. float32 mode would be another big
win on a consumer GPU (8× FP32 vs FP64 on Ampere) at the cost of some
near-photon-sphere precision.

Polar-axis BL singularity from Phase 4 is unchanged — the GPU integrator
inherits the same artefact. The fix is still the generic axis-reflection
step in the integrator and is now Phase 6 work.

### 2026-05-07 — Phase 4: Kerr metric (rotating black hole)

Phase 4 is in. The integrator was not touched — the Kerr metric drops in
through the same `MetricProtocol` (`rs`, `christoffel_symbols`,
`acceleration`) that Schwarzschild uses. Spin a = 0.99 M renders and a
4-panel a ∈ {0, 0.5, 0.9, 0.99} comparison are wired up.

New / changed:
- `src/metrics/kerr.py` — `KerrMetric(mass, spin)` in Boyer-Lindquist
  coordinates. Closed-form `metric_tensor`, `inverse_metric` (uses the exact
  identity `det(g_{tφ block}) = -Δ sin²θ`), `metric_derivatives` and
  `christoffel_symbols`. The integrator's hot path is `acceleration`, which
  is fully inlined: one `_aux` call per step, the dg matrix entries are kept
  as scalars, and the final 4-vector contraction is hand-unrolled. `rs` is
  set to the outer horizon `r_+ = M + √(M² − a²)` so the integrator's
  termination radius and step bands track the actual horizon, not 2M.
- `src/scene/kerr_accretion_disk.py` — `KerrAccretionDisk` with the
  Bardeen-Press-Teukolsky ISCO via Z₁, Z₂; defaults `inner_radius` to the
  prograde ISCO (≈ 1.45 M at a = 0.99). Uses prograde Kepler
  Ω = √M / (r^{3/2} + a √M). Per-photon redshift is computed from the
  conserved scalars: lower indices using the equatorial Kerr metric, then
  `g = E / [u^t (E − Ω L)]` applied to both temperature and beaming.
- `src/render/curved_renderer.py` — `_build_initial_momenta` now takes
  the gravitational radius scale `r_grav = 2M`, not the integrator's `rs`.
  For Schwarzschild the two coincide (rs = 2M); for Kerr the asymptotic
  static-observer redshift wants 2M, not the smaller r_+. Verified: all
  Schwarzschild tests pass unchanged.
- `examples/kerr_render.py` — a = 0.99 render at 800×600, 75° inclination,
  saved to `gallery/kerr_render.png`.
- `examples/spin_comparison.py` — 4-panel a ∈ {0, 0.5, 0.9, 0.99} tile at
  400×300 each with labels, saved to `gallery/spin_comparison.png`.
- Tests: `tests/metrics/test_kerr.py` (11 cases) covers parameter
  validation, horizon shrinkage with spin, exact reduction to Schwarzschild
  at a = 0 (metric and Christoffels), inverse-metric consistency, lower-
  index symmetry of Γ, agreement of inlined `acceleration` with the
  full-Christoffel route, integrator drop-in, and L_z conservation.
  `tests/scene/test_kerr_accretion_disk.py` (9 cases) covers the ISCO
  formula (6M at a=0, → M as a → M, retrograde > prograde), annulus
  clipping, the static-redshift-only path, and the Doppler asymmetry that
  spin produces. Two pre-existing physical-disk tests had wrong physics
  premises (claimed inner pixel brighter than outer, and g_dop = 1 for a
  radial photon) — both rewritten in terms of the correct physics
  (spectral character / time-dilation 1/γ).

Performance — the Kerr per-ray cost is the bottleneck:
- First Kerr cut (christoffel_symbols → einsum acceleration): ~42 rays/s
  single-thread on the 80×60 smoke test (matches the old Schwarzschild
  baseline before its Phase-2.5 rework).
- After hand-inlining `acceleration` (no full Γ tensor, scalar dg entries,
  unrolled final contraction): **~231 rays/s single-thread, 5.5× speedup.**
- Kerr is now ~4.6× slower per-ray than Schwarzschild's closed-form path
  (1067 rays/s). Acceptable given the substantially heavier metric. The
  main remaining win is per-ray vectorisation across the integrator — Phase
  5 work.

The integrator change-set is empty: zero edits in `src/geodesic/integrator.py`.

Known limitation in this phase: rays whose backward-traced trajectory grazes
the spin axis (θ → 0 or θ → π) hit the Boyer-Lindquist coordinate
singularity — `g^{φφ} ∝ 1/sin²θ` blows up there, the RK4 stride punches
across the axis, and those pixels emerge as a thin dark streak through the
projection of the +y spin axis on the image. The fix is a generic axis-
reflection step in the integrator (`θ → -θ`, `φ → φ + π` when θ wraps past
zero), which would equally benefit Schwarzschild renders that happen to aim
at the pole. Deferred until Phase 5 along with the per-ray vectorisation
work, since both are integrator-level changes.

### 2026-05-06 — Phase 2.5: parallel + closed-form-Christoffel optimisation

Cut single-thread renderer overhead and fanned the work out across CPU cores.
The Schwarzschild integration is now ~25× faster end-to-end at 80×60 (1067
rays/s vs 42 rays/s baseline) and should land the 400×300 reference render in
2–3 minutes instead of ~48 minutes.

Changes:
- `src/metrics/schwarzschild.py` — added `acceleration(x, p)` returning
  `-Γ^μ_{αβ} p^α p^β` directly from the 11 non-zero connection coefficients,
  skipping the (4, 4, 4) tensor allocation and the einsum dispatch on every
  RK4 substep. Verified against `christoffel_symbols + einsum` to 4e-15.
- `src/geodesic/integrator.py` — the integrator picks up
  `metric.acceleration` automatically when present (still falls back to
  einsum/Christoffel for metrics without it, keeping the protocol generic).
  Step sizing is now three-tier: `r < 3 rs` uses `near_field_factor`,
  `r > 10 rs` uses a new `far_field_factor` (default 2.0), middle band uses
  `base_step`. Per-step constants are hoisted out of the loop and the accel
  closure is built once per call.
- `src/render/curved_renderer.py` — rewritten to vectorise per-pixel initial
  conditions (basis projection + null 4-momentum) and dispatch chunks to a
  `multiprocessing.Pool` (spawn context, so it works on Windows). Per-chunk
  progress percentage is printed as results land via `imap_unordered`. New
  `n_workers` (default = `os.cpu_count()`) and `chunks_per_worker` knobs;
  `n_workers=1` skips multiprocessing entirely for debugging.
- `examples/schwarzschild_render.py` — passes `far_field_factor=2.0`, prints
  total wall-clock render time at the end.

All 14 existing tests still pass without modification. Energy and L_z
conservation tests use explicit `base_step`/`near_field_factor` so they're
unaffected by the new defaults; the metric-agnostic stub test still
exercises the einsum fallback (the stub has no `acceleration`).

### 2026-05-06 — Phase 2 complete: Schwarzschild geodesic ray tracer

Phase 2 (curved spacetime, Schwarzschild) is working end-to-end. The first
ray-traced black hole image is at `gallery/schwarzschild_test.png`: it shows
the event horizon shadow, the lensed back-side of the accretion disk arching
over the BH ("Interstellar" effect), the photon ring at the shadow edge, and
the underside of the disk wrapping below.

Key files:
- `src/metrics/schwarzschild.py` — `SchwarzschildMetric` (M=1, rs=2 by default)
  with `metric_tensor()` and `christoffel_symbols()` in (t, r, θ, φ).
- `src/geodesic/integrator.py` — `GeodesicIntegrator` (RK4) and `GeodesicResult`
  dataclass. Metric-agnostic via `MetricProtocol`. Adaptive step (×0.1 inside
  r < 5 rs). Termination on horizon, escape (r ≥ r_max), in-annulus equatorial
  crossing (disk hit), or max_steps.
- `src/render/curved_renderer.py` — `CurvedRenderer` with Cartesian↔spherical
  conversion helpers and a static-observer null-momentum builder.
- `examples/schwarzschild_render.py` — camera at (0, 5, −30), M=1, disk
  r ∈ [3 rs, 12 rs] = [6, 24], 60° FOV, 400×300.
- `tests/metrics/test_schwarzschild.py`, `tests/geodesic/test_integrator.py` —
  14 tests covering metric components, Christoffel values & symmetry,
  horizon/escape/disk termination, energy & axial-angular-momentum
  conservation along a geodesic, and metric-agnostic integration with a
  zero-connection stub. All pass.

Benchmark: 400×300 = 120 000 rays in **2853.78 s (~47.6 min) at 42 rays/s**
on a single Python thread. The hot loop is per-ray RK4 with `np.einsum` over
the (4,4,4) Christoffel tensor; far-field rays escape quickly while near-BH
rays loop many steps around the photon sphere, so the rate is uneven through
the frame.

**Next session — Phase 3:** vectorise the integrator across rays so all pixels
advance in lockstep. Expected speed-up of 50–200× from amortising Python /
NumPy call overhead. After that, add gravitational redshift / Doppler shifting
for the disk emission and a starfield background.

### 2026-05-06 — Phase 1 complete

Phase 1 (flat spacetime ray tracer) is complete. A pinhole camera model,
accretion disk geometry, and closest-hit renderer are all working and produce
a correct perspective image (`gallery/flat_test.png`).

Key files:
- `src/camera/camera.py` — `Camera` class, fully vectorised ray generation
- `src/scene/accretion_disk.py` — `AccretionDisk` class, y=0 plane intersection, checkerboard colour
- `src/render/renderer.py` — `Renderer` class, closest-hit compositing, PNG export
- `examples/flat_render.py` — end-to-end example: camera at (0, 5, −15), disk r∈[3, 12], 800×600

**Next session — Phase 2:** implement the Schwarzschild metric and geodesic
equations. Entry points will be `src/metrics/` (metric tensor, Christoffel
symbols) and `src/geodesic/` (RK45 null geodesic integrator).

### 2026-05-06 — Docstring cleanup; Progress Log convention added

Trimmed all docstrings in `src/` and `examples/` to be concise and natural.
Removed verbose prose, redundant parameter explanations, and the numbered
Algorithm block in `renderer.py`. Protocol method stubs now have single-line
docstrings. No logic was changed.

Added the "Working Convention" section to this file establishing the rule:
append a Progress Log entry after every completed task.

### 2026-05-06 — Expanded CLAUDE.md with project standards

Added four new sections: Code Quality Standards, Documentation Standards,
Performance, and Architecture Principles. Key decisions recorded:
- Geodesic integrator must be metric-agnostic (Schwarzschild ↔ Kerr = one-line swap).
- Scene objects share a common `intersect()` / `color()` interface.
- Renderer is decoupled from spacetime geometry entirely.
- Render times must be benchmarked and logged.
- Academic paper references required where applicable.
